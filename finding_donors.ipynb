    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** I have used following three supervised learning algorithms: \n",
    "1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**:Gaussian Naive Bayes was my first candidate for model selection because of it being a probabilistic classifier. Naive Bayes is used in the field of spam filtering. It compares the likelihood of the words appearing in the spam mails as compared to the non-spam mails. This allows Naive Bayes to be used for text classification and filtering. The Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier is a strong classifier due to it being an independent classifier. This means that the features of a dataset are independent of each other. However, one problem with the Naive Bayes classifier as compared to the other classifiers is that it creates problems when the training data is scarce or incomplete. Also continous features create problem for the Naive Bayes Classifiers. I chose Naive Bayes due to the features present in our dataset which due as their independence from each other can help the model make accurate predictions. \n",
    "2. **Support Vector Classifier**:The second Classifier, Support Vector Machine is an excellent choice for classifying binary datasets. SVMs are used in face detection as well as classification. They are also used in genetic classification. The strength of the SVM lies in the fact that it has a regularization which avoids overfitting of the model. SVM is also a good performer on a dataset with multiple attribute. However, the weakness of the model lies in the choice of the kernel. Also, it is slow on larger datasets. An SVM has a regularisation parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. SVM is a good performer on a dataset with multple attributes. This comes in handy when there are fewer cases for training the data. Due to this reason, I selected SVM for the given dataset. \n",
    "3. **Adaboost Classifier**: The Adaboost Classifier or Adaptive boosting a strong learning algorithm that is used in binary classification problems. An Adaboost Classifier is used in detecting and classifying facial images. Adaboost has become a popular algorithm in many Kaggle competitions where the participants use it extensively. The Adaboost Classifier is a fast algorithm. It is easier to implement and there are no parameters to tune except for the number of instances the model will iterate. The model performs poorly when there are complex weak learners which can sometimes lead to the problem of overfitting. Also, empirically, it is proven that the Adaboost Classifer is vulnerable to the uniform noise. Due to the organized dataset, this algorithm can be used to achieve a good accuracy score in a short period of time. It can perform many iterations of a weak learner hypothesis which can lead to faster prediction of the given test set. \n"

In both the terms of Accuracy Score and F-Score on the Test Set, the Adaboost Classifier performs better than SVM and Naive Bayes. Although in the training set, the model is slightly outperfromed by SVM, but in rest of the cases this gets compensated as the Adaboost performs significantly better. Also, the Adaboost Classifier is much better than SVM in terms of time taken for performing prediction. Therefore, according to me, the Adaboost Classifier is a much suited algorithm for identifying individuals that make more than $50,000."

    "**Answer: ** An Adaboost Classifier is an ensemble classifier that creates a strong classifier using combination of several weaker classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weak classifiers can be understood with a following analogy from an ancient Indian Parable about a group of blind men who encounter an elephant. The blind men inspect the elephant individually with several features through its trunk, ear, legs and tail. That is, they learn the various features of elephant. However, they are not able to identify the elephant in whole individually which makes them weak learners. However, they can combine the features learnt to create a full image of an elephant. The blind men can be called analogous to the weak learners in our Classifier who identify few features but aggregate together to form a strong intuition which can identify the elephant. [1]\n",
    "![title](blind_men_.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, through a visual example, we can get a whole picture of the concept of weak learners in Adaboost Classifiers: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. At first equal weights are given to each data point and applying a decision boundary to classify the points as '+' and '-'. However, the first classifier has incorrectly three '+' points to be '-'. We will apply higher weight to these three '+' points and create another subsequent classifier. \n",
    "![title](d1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, our classifier has accurately predicted the three '+' points on right side of the box which were allotted higher weight in the previous classifier. However, it still misclassifies three '-' points and we will again give higher weight to these misclassified points. \n",
    "![title](d2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The three misclassified '-' from the previous classifier are given higher weights and a line is drawn to separate '+' and '-' points accurately based on the higher weights of misclassified points. \n",
    "![title](d3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now we combine our three weak learners into one and we observe that our algorithm has classified the data points quite accurately as compared to our previous weak learners. \n",
    "![title](d4.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adaboost Classifier works using the same principle by taking weak learners and fitting the points based on the variation in their assigned weights. Initially, the weights are set equal across all weak learners. If the prediction made by a learner is incorrect, then higher weight is given to the misclassified datapoint(s). Then, iteratively, it continues to add these learners until a limit is reached in number of models or accuracy. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "An adaboost classifier takes up a large amount of data and divides it into different categories. This reduces the burden on our model for accurate prediction as it takes few features at one time.[3]\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
